<p>Contributions are welcome! Here are some ways to contribute.</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a feature</li>
<li>Fix a bug</li>
<li>Improve or contribute to documentation</li>
<li>And more...</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are contributing to this project as part of <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com" >Hacktoberfest<a/>, please keep in mind that <em>quality</em> is more important that quantity. Correcting a typo or syntax error that you've found is great! But creating a pull request to remove white space or something that is more a <em>hinerance vs. helping</em> does not align with the spirit of Hacktoberfest and may be marked as invalid.</p>
